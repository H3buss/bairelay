//! A read burst triggered by the camera's **spontaneous wake**.
//!
//! # Pourquoi ce module existe
//!
//! The battery is the field emergency: no timer reads the camera any more
//! (`idle_disconnect = true`, `battery_update` set to "never"), so the battery
//! level only came back up if a person asked for
//! `query/settings`. The camera, on its side, wakes itself up: a press on the
//! button, a motion report, a recording pushed on the fake cloud's
//! channel. Every wake is a window where one can read **for free** — the
//! radio is already open.
//!
//! A burst is that window: a few commands, paid for by the wake, never
//! ailleurs.
//!
//! # The four rules, and why tests lock them
//!
//! 1. **One wake = one burst.** The guard ([`BurstGuard`]`) refuses a second
//!    burst while the first one runs *and* for [`GUARD_WINDOW`] after
//!    it. Three sources can announce the same wake (the session, the
//!    webhook, the push): without this, one would pay three bursts at once.
//! 2. **Never periodic, never at startup.** This module has no
//!    `interval`, no cadencing `sleep`, and is called by no
//!    startup path: the memory of
//!    [`crate::family_state::proven_families`] is enough to publish the discovery
//!    without radio. The module's only `sleep` is the session-wait probe
//!    ([`await_session`]), bounded, which emits no command at all.
//! 3. **Never during a stream.** [`CameraHandle::stream_in_progress`] refuses the
//!    burst while a `StreamSource` has subscribers: a camera sending
//!    video is not the moment to ask it for ten XML blocks. The audio
//!    dialogue, on its side, is a **separate process** (`bairelay parler`,
//!    `pont-audio`): the bridge cannot see it, and the report says so — that
//!    guard-rail is not in this binary.
//! 4. **A high bound on commands, logged.** [`COMMAND_BUDGET`] is the
//!    maximum spend of a burst, evaluated before leaving ([`build_plan`])
//!    and written in the log together with what it dropped. An expensive family
//!    (`chime`, five commands) does not eat the whole window without that
//!    voie.
//!
//! # What happens when the camera refuses
//!
//! Two refusals, and they do not look alike.
//!
//! * **The camera answered nothing** ([`Verdict::Unknown`]: no session,
//!   unreachable): the burst stops **on the spot**, the families already read
//!   stay published, and the lock is returned — insisting on a camera that does
//!   not answer is not paid for twice.
//! * **The camera answered "no"** ([`Verdict::Transient`]: a `400`, a
//!   deadline, an unusable block): the burst **continues**. Measured on 13 November on
//!   this doorbell: `image` (26), `osd` (44), `motion` (46) and `mask` (52)
//!   return `400` even with the camera **properly awake**, while battery (253),
//!   PIR (212) and the chime answer in the same session. One family's refusal
//!   therefore teaches nothing about the next one, and the old rule — stop at
//!   the first `400` — kept the chime from ever being read for weeks:
//!   the tour dead at four commands out of eight, `chime` never reached.
//!
//! Two guard-rails keep that "continue" from turning into waste: two
//! **consecutive** refusals return the session ([`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_REFUSALS`]) — a camera
//! that says no twice in a row probably will not say anything better — and a
//! family refused on [`FAMILY_MAX_REFUSALS`] wakes in a row leaves the plan
//! ([`BurstGuard::family_saturated`]): one does not buy the same closed
//! door a hundred times. The reason for each refusal stays published by
//! [`crate::settings::read_family`] itself.
//!
//! # The memory of families
//!
//! The burst guesses no family: it re-reads the ones whose writability was
//! **already proven** ([`crate::family_state`]), and writes that memory
//! **only once** per burst — a single call to
//! [`CameraHandle::mark_families_read`] at the end of the burst, which is the only
//! path that touches the disk.
