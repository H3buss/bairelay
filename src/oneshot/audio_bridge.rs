//! `audio-bridge` — the live bridge between Home Assistant and the doorbell.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! go2rtc (Home Assistant add-on) pipes the browser microphone into this
//! process's **stdin** as headerless signed 16-bit little-endian PCM at
//! 16000 Hz mono — its `exec` source with `#backchannel=1#audio=s16le/16000` —
//! and reads the camera's own audio back out of the RTSP stream it is already
//! pulling, which is why nothing here sends audio *up* the pipe: the return
//! path is the camera's regular stream, and this protocol has no file upload at
//! all. So this command has exactly one job: turn the bytes on stdin into the
//! camera's ADPCM blocks and write them to its loudspeaker, for as long as the
//! caller speaks.
//!
//! # Session lifecycle (the part that can wedge a doorbell)
//!
//! One BC login for the whole process — reconnecting costs 2–4 s and would sit
//! in the middle of a sentence. Talk sessions, however, are opened **per speech
//! burst**: `TalkConfig` (msg 201) at the first byte, audio blocks (msg 202) as
//! they arrive, `talk_reset` (msg 11) when the caller stops. The reason is
//! orphan avoidance. A process that is SIGKILLed — go2rtc recycling the
//! source, the OOM killer, a container restart — cannot send msg 11 *ever*, so
//! a session left open across silence is an orphan the camera holds open on its
//! own timer, and while it holds it the doorbell is deaf to its own microphone
//! and the talk slot is taken. Keeping a session open across silence buys a few
//! hundred milliseconds on the next utterance and risks exactly the state we
//! cannot clear from here; closing it on every gap risks nothing. That is the
//! whole trade, and it is why `--idle` defaults to 2 s.
//!
//! On stdin EOF (go2rtc ending the call is *normal*, not an error) and on
//! Ctrl+C the sender is dropped, which is the end-of-stream signal
//! [`BcCamera::talk_stream`] understands: it flushes what is queued, waits out
//! the audio still scheduled to play, and sends msg 11 itself. Ctrl+C therefore
//! costs one graceful close, not an orphan — provided the signal reaches us
//! (a `SIGKILL` is the case no program can handle, which is the other half of
//! the reasoning above).
//!
//! # Latency and memory
//!
//! Blocks are produced as stdin delivers them, so latency is one block
//! (64 ms at this camera's `lengthPerEncoder = 1024`). If the camera stops
//! draining its TCP socket, the queue is capped at ~10 s of audio and the burst
//! is cut rather than letting an unbounded backlog grow in a process that is
//! meant to survive for hours; stale audio in a live intercom is worthless, and
//! a stalled camera deserves a closed session, not a memory leak.
