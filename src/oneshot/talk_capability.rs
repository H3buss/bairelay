//! `talk-abilite` one-shot — ask the camera for its `<TalkAbility>`
//! (msg id 10) **without** the `two_way_audio` ability gate, and print the
//! raw answer.
//!
//! # Why ungated
//!
//! The normal entry point, `BcCamera::talk_ability()`, refuses to send
//! anything unless the login's `AbilityInfo` advertised `two_way_audio`.
//! That is the right default for a caller that intends to talk — it saves a
//! round trip on a camera that cannot — but it makes the question
//! "does this box actually have a talk path?" unanswerable on firmware that
//! under-reports its abilities. This family has already been caught
//! answering `405` to `<HaCfg>` while happily accepting `<Email>`, both
//! absent from its advertised list. So this diagnostic calls
//! [`BcCamera::talk_ability_probe`] (a copy of the request with the gate
//! removed) and reports exactly what came back: XML, empty ack, or a bare
//! error code. The gate itself is untouched for every other caller.
//!
//! Read-only by construction: msg id 10 is the capability read. Nothing
//! here sends `TalkConfig` (201), audio (202) or a talk reset (11).
//!
//! # Why it wants the concrete `BcCamera`
//!
//! `talk_ability_probe` lives on `BcCamera`, not on the `CameraDriver`
//! trait — deliberately, since the trait is the seam every service-side
//! caller goes through and this is a CLI diagnostic, not a feature. Same
//! shape as `snapshot --use-stream-raw`: [`run`] takes `&BcCamera` and is
//! reached from `run_oneshot`'s concrete-handle branch, while
//! [`run_via_driver`] answers the trait-object route with a clear error.
