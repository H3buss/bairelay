//! The memory of the settings families **held to be writable**.
//!
//! # The problem this file solves
//!
//! A settings family is published modifiable (slider, select,
//! switch with a command topic) only after the camera has **answered a read of it**
//! successfully. That is the bridge's rule: never promise a write on
//! a tag that has not been read.
//!
//! But that verdict lived only in the process memory. Concretely, on the
//! doorbell:
//!
//! * at startup, everything goes out read-only;
//! * a full burst is needed (`query/settings`, ~15 radio commands, and the
//!   camera has to be woken) for the families to get their status back;
//! * and **a restart of the add-on forgets everything**, so the camera pays
//!   fifteen radio commands again to recover what it had already proven
//!   the day before.
//!
//! This module therefore persists, on the add-on's disk, the list of families
//! for which the bridge has proof they are writable. On the next start, it
//! marks them writable **without sending a single packet to the camera**.
//!
//! # Where the file is, and why there
//!
//! Next to the configuration file, under the name [`FAMILIES_READ_FILE`] — the
//! same location as [`crate::config::CLOUD_AUTH_FILE`], an explicit precedent.
//! In the Home Assistant add-on, that is `/config/bairelay/`: a directory
//! already mounted read-write, which survives image updates, and which is
//! **not** the repository. Nothing is written into the code tree.
//!
//! # What the file does not contain
//!
//! Family slugs, nothing else: no setting value, no
//! identifier, no secret. The file is therefore useless outside the bridge
//! and contains nothing to protect.
//!
//! # The three survival rules
//!
//! 1. **Never a camera command**: this module only reads and writes a
//!    file. Marking a family writable wakes nobody up.
//! 2. **Never a failed start**: absent file = current behaviour
//!    (everything read-only until the first re-read); unreadable or invalid
//!    file = same, with a warning. The bridge always starts.
//! 3. **Never a half write**: write into a temporary file of the same
//!    directory then rename. A crash leaves the old file intact,
//!    never a truncated JSON.
