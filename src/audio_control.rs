//! `bairelay audio-check` — a **camera-free, network-free** round trip
//! through the talk path: encode a file with the same [`AdpcmEncoder`] `talk`

//!
//! - does the encoder lose or invent samples, and does the count close over a

//! - is the error at a block seam bigger than the error anywhere else, and do
//!   the error jumps all land on the same remainder (that is what a periodic
//!   click looks like in numbers);
//! - does the header sample of each block come back bit-exact, or is it a
//!   replay of the sample before it (which is what `--header repeat` does);
//! - how much jitter this OS puts into a 64 ms nap, relative versus absolute
//!   (`--bench`), which is how a sender decides whether to pace by naps or by
