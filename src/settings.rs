//! Applying MQTT settings and publishing what the camera re-read.
//!
//! The `control/<family>/<leaf>` message arrives already validated by
//! [`bairelay_mqtt::settings`] (range, length, allowed text): no out-of-range
//! value ever reaches the camera from here. This module does three things, in this
//! order:
//!
//! 1. it **re-reads** the block concerned — a Baichuan write is a
//!    read-modify-write of the whole block (see `docs/protocol-notes.md`), and
//!    adding to the block a tag the firmware did not send is the fault this
//!    bridge refuses everywhere (same rule as
//!    `src/oneshot/audio_settings.rs::present`) ;
//! 2. it writes the modified block ;
//! 3. it publishes, leaf by leaf, **what the camera re-read**.
//!
//! Point 3 is the law of this module. A retained state on the broker that repeated
//! the *requested* value would survive a bridge restart, hide a firmware that
//! ignores the write, and make Home Assistant lie.
//!
//! When the camera **refuses** a family, that family's retained states are cleared
//! (empty retained payload: HA shows “unknown”) and not replaced
//! by a default value. “Refused” and “empty” must stay distinct —
//! that is what, on a doorbell with no chime paired, tells a legitimate empty list
//! (`[]`) apart from a camera that did not answer (no state at all).
//!
//! Settings do not go through the [`CameraDriver`] trait: they are read/write pairs
//! specific to the Baichuan protocol, and the trait is not meant to
//! carry thirty methods. The dispatch therefore goes through the concrete [`BcCamera`]
//! this module knows how to interrogate, block by block.
