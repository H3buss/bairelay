///   once, and the header slot is even a small gift: one sample per block
///   survives with zero coding error.
/// - [`HeaderConvention::RepeatPrevious`]: the header carries the reconstruction
///   state the previous block ended on, which is therefore a *replay* of the
///   sample the decoder has already produced. A decoder following the IMA
///   convention plays that sample twice, so one sample is duplicated every
