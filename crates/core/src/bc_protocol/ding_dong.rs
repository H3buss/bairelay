//! The paired-chime (ding-dong) family: msgs 483 / 484 / 485 / 486 / 487 /
//! 609 / 610, reached **through the doorbell's session** — the chime has no
//! network address of its own; the doorbell speaks for it.
//!
//! # Shape of the family (and why this file looks nothing like `audio.rs`)
//!
//! `<audioCfg>` is one block read whole and written whole. The chime is spread
//! over five questions:
//!
//! | msg | asks | answers |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | 484 | (empty body) | `<dingdongDeviceInfo>` per paired wireless chime |
//! | 483 | `<dingdongCtrl><opt>machineStateGet` | hardwired chime block |
//! | 485 | `<dingdongDeviceOpt><opt>getParam` + `<id>` | `name` / `volLevel` / `ledState` |
//! | 609 | `<dingdongSilentMode><id>` | `<time>` |
//! | 486 | (empty body) | `<deviceCfg>` per device, `<alarminCfg>` per event |
//!
//! Each part a camera doesn't have is **refused, not answered empty**, so
//! [`get_ding_dong_cfg`] reads all five softly — a non-200 turns that *part*
//! into `None` and costs nothing else — and only refuses entirely when the
//! camera answered none of the family (that is a connection talking nonsense,
//! not a doorbell without a chime).
//!
//! Writes are the mirror: [`set_ding_dong_cfg`] re-reads, diffs the caller's
//! block against what the camera holds **right now**, and sends only the parts
//! whose text actually changed — whole blocks, never partial ones. The diff is
//! not an optimisation: msg 610 re-arms the chime's mute countdown just by
//! arriving, so blindly "re-writing the received block" would silently mute a
//! user's chime again. And as everywhere in this crate, a tag the camera never
//! printed is never invented: asking to change one is a caller error and
//! nothing goes on the wire.
//!
//! # Why there is no ability gate
//!
//! `get_audio_cfg` can check `audioCfg` in the camera's `abilityInfo` because
//! that token is documented. The chime family has **no abilityInfo token at
//! all** (the protocol note is explicit that the chime ability is queried by
//! the commands themselves), so a gate could only check a token invented here
//! — which would veto exactly the cameras that do have a chime. The answer to
//! 484 is the only support test that counts, and a soft read already says it.
//! If a future `abilities` dump shows a real chime token, adding the gate is
//! five lines and one decision.
//!
//! # Known unknowns (settled only on hardware — do not "fix" these by guessing)
//!
//! - The **root element of replies** is documented only by its inner tags. The
//!   read assumes the reply echoes the request's carrier (`dingdongCtrl` /
//!   `dingdongDeviceInfo` / `dingdongDeviceOpt` / `deviceCfg` /
//!   `dingdongSilentMode`). For the chime list the **second documented root**
//!   is read too — msg 484 is double-use, reply and push, and the pushed
//!   variant is `<dingdongList>` — through [`BcXml::dingdong_chimes`]. Any
//!   other root still decodes to `None` / `UnintelligibleReply`: wrong-but-safe,
//!   no invented tag, and 484 answering 200 with nothing addressable is
//!   reported as [`DingDongCfg::list_answered_without_entry`] rather than as
//!   « no chime paired ».
//! - `volLevel` is "0-4 typical", the real ceiling unknown; `musicId` is a
//!   free integer with **no melody list** anywhere; the unit of 483's `<time>`
//!   and 609's `<time>` is undocumented; 610's `<type>63</type>` is copied
//!   from the reference client with its meaning unknown; the event-type
//!   vocabulary of 486 is whatever the camera printed (discover by reading).
//! - Values are kept as camera `String` text throughout, so an undocumented
//!   value survives read → report → write-back unchanged. Same caveat as
//!   [`AudioCfg`](crate::bc::xml::AudioCfg): serde drops tags this crate
//!   doesn't model, and they would be absent from a write-back.
